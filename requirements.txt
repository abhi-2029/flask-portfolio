How to Generate/Update Your requirements.txt:
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows


Generate the file automatically:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

For production, you may want to pin exact versions:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Additional Recommendations:
For development, you might want separate files:

requirements-dev.txt (development-only packages)

requirements.txt (production requirements)

If you're using SQLite (as in your code), you don't need additional database drivers, but if you switch to other databases later, you'll need to add:
psycopg2-binary==2.9.6  # For PostgreSQL
mysql-connector-python==8.0.33  # For MySQL


For deployment, make sure to specify exact versions (using ==) as shown above to prevent compatibility issues.
